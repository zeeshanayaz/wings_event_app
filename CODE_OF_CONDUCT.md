## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instance of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions, comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other interactions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
